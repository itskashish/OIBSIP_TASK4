Contains Java development program - ONLINE EXAMINATION

The "OnlineExamination" program is a simple Java console application that simulates an online examination system. It includes functionalities such as user login, profile updating, multiple-choice question answering, a timer for time-limited quizzes, and session closure/logout. Users can log in, update their profiles, answer a sample multiple-choice question, and experience an auto-submit feature when the timer reaches its limit. This code serves as a foundational template for building more sophisticated online examination systems.
